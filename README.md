# aws-asg-cloudfront

This project demonstrates how to combine cloudfront, EC2, route53 and auto scaling groups to build a scalable http service with any load balancers.

**NOTE:** This project is a work in progress, I am shaving a few yaks along way.

# Why?

The reason I built this example is that application load balancers introduce an unnecessary layer of complexity and cost in cases were your already using a CDN such as cloudfront in front of your application.
